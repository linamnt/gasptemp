Title: FIP 

Every year the Department of Physiology hosts Frontiers in Physiology (FIP), a symposium which brings together and encourages interactions between graduate students and faculty members from all four platforms and institutions, allowing us to share our work and findings.

This year, we will be hosting the 37th Annual FIP Symposium on May 9th, 2017, following the Macallum Lecture on May 8th, 2017 by our world-renowned Macallum and FIP speaker, Professor Catherine Dulac, Higgins Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard University. Dr. Dulacâ€™s research interests in epigenetics, olfactory and pheromone signalling in sexual behaviour will appeal to all members of the Department.

We look forward to organizing a successful and eventful FIP symposium. Keep these dates free, and we hope to see you all there!

Stay tuned for more information!
