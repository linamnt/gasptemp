GASP is holding its first (non-pub night) social of 2017, and this month we'll be going to play pool at **VIP Lounge & Billiards Club (385 Yonge St.)**! This event will be at **7:00 pm on Thursday, January 19**, and will be just $5 for PSL students and $7 for guests! So come out, meet your fellow PSL students over a drink and a game of pool, and apps courtesy of GASP!
