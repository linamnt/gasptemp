Title: Ice Skating
Date: 2017-01-10

Join GASP for some ice skating at **Nathan Phillips Square on Wednesday, January 25th, 6:30pm**. We will be leaving from MSB at 6pm to walk over together. Skate rentals are $10 for 2 hours and costs for PSL students will be subsidized for a portion, depending on the number of attendees. If you have your own skates you're good to go!

RSVP to John at swjohn.choi@mail.utoronto.ca and indicate if you need to rent skates.
