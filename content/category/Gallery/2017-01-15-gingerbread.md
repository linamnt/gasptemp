Title: Gingerbread Decorating Pictures
Date: 2017-01-15

Remember way back in December when GASP held the gingerbread decorating competition? Here are the pictures to prove what a great night it was! Congrats to the winners (Frances, Lina and Shahin) for their beautiful DNA licorice ladder, and to the second place winners (Ursula, Kenny, and Melanie) for their more artistic approach. Thanks to everyone who came out and joined us!
